There is much variability of the measured permittivity from one sample to another for the same type of tissue requiring different Cole-Cole fitting parameters. However, no studies have been conducted on the dependence of the Cole-Cole fitting parameters on tissue constituents such as their geometry, concentration and distribution. In this communication, a single-pole Cole-Cole model is used to fit the frequency dependence of the dielectric permittivity of fatty tissues. Different geometries of water distribution in fat are studied. Multiple scattering full wave simulation is shown to be a useful approach to catalog and analyze different types of geometries. This study can serve as a useful tool to extract more detailed information about a biological tissue from its dielectric permittivity and explain the variation of the measured data.},

	abstract = {Spectral induced polarization (SIP) data are commonly analysed using phenomenological models. Among these models the Cole–Cole (CC) model is the most popular choice to describe the strength and frequency dependence of distinct polarization peaks in the data. More flexibility regarding the shape of the spectrum is provided by decomposition schemes. Here the spectral response is decomposed into individual responses of a chosen elementary relaxation model, mathematically acting as kernel in the involved integral, based on a broad range of relaxation times. A frequently used kernel function is the Debye model, but also the CC model with some other a priorly specified frequency dispersion (e.g. Warburg model) has been proposed as kernel in the decomposition. The different decomposition approaches in use, also including conductivity and resistivity formulations, pose the question to which degree the integral spectral parameters typically derived from the obtained relaxation time distribution are biased by the approach itself. Based on synthetic SIP data sampled from an ideal CC response, we here investigate how the two most important integral output parameters deviate from the corresponding CC input parameters. We find that the total chargeability may be underestimated by up to 80 per cent and the mean relaxation time may be off by up to three orders of magnitude relative to the original values, depending on the frequency dispersion of the analysed spectrum and the proximity of its peak to the frequency range limits considered in the decomposition. We conclude that a quantitative comparison of SIP parameters across different studies, or the adoption of parameter relationships from other studies, for example when transferring laboratory results to the field, is only possible on the basis of a consistent spectral analysis procedure. This is particularly important when comparing effective CC parameters with spectral parameters derived from decomposition results.},

The polarization current density is approached using Lagrange extrapolation polynomial, and the fractional derivation is obtained according to Riemann definition of a fractional α-order derivative. Reflection coefficients at an air/muscle and air/fat tissues interfaces simulated in a 1-D domain are found in good agreement with those obtained from the analytic model over a broad frequency range, demonstrating the validity of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Objective: 
To determine whether the bioimpedance analysis (BIA) ratios of upper to lower extremities could predict treatment outcomes after complex decongestive therapy (CDT) for gynecological cancer related lymphedema (GCRL).

Methods:
A retrospective study, from March 2015 to December 2018, was conducted. The study sample comprised patients receiving CDT, 30 minutes per day, for 10 days. Bioimpedance was measured pre- and post-CDT. Circumference measurements were obtained at 20 and 10 cm above the knee (AK) and 10 cm below the knee (BK). We calculated the expected impedance at 0 Hz (R0) of extremities and upper/lower extremity R0 ratios (R0U/L). We evaluated the relationship between R0U/L and changes in R0U/L and circumferences, pre- and post-CDT.

Results:
Overall, 59 patients were included in this study. Thirty-one lower extremities in 26 patients comprised the acute group, and 38 lower extremities in 33 patients comprised the chronic group. Pre-treatment R0U/L was significantly correlated with R0U/L change after adjusting for age and BMI (acute: R=0.513, p{\textless}0.01; chronic: R=0.423, p{\textless}0.01). In the acute group, pre-treatment R0U/L showed a tendency to be correlated with circumference change (AK 20 cm: R=0.427, p=0.02; AK 10 cm: R=0.399, p=0.03).

Conclusion:
Our study results suggested that pre-treatment BIA could predict volume reductions after CDT in the early stages of GCRL. These findings implied that BIA value could be one possible parameter to apply in treatment outcomes prediction, during the early stage of GCRL. Therefore, further large-scale prospective studies will be beneficial.},

	abstract = {Purpose To develop and apply a method to measure in vivo electrical conductivity values using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in subjects with breast cancer. Materials and Methods A recently developed technique named MREPT (MR electrical properties tomography) together with a novel coil combination process was used to quantify the conductivity values. The overall technique was validated using a phantom study. In addition, 90 subjects were imaged (50 subjects with previously biopsy-confirmed breast tumor and 40 normal subjects), which was approved by our institutional review board (IRB). A routine clinical protocol, specifically a T2-weighted FSE (fast spin echo) imaging data, was used for reconstruction of conductivity. Results By employing the coil combination, the relative error in the conductivity map was reduced from ∼70\% to 10\%. The average conductivity values in breast cancers regions (0.89 ± 0.33S/m) was higher compared to parenchymal tissue (0.43 S/m, P {\textless} 0.0001) and fat (0.07 S/m, P {\textless} 0.00005) regions. Malignant cases (0.89 S/m, n = 30) showed increased conductivity compared to benign cases (0.56 S/m, n = 5) (P {\textless} 0.05). In addition, invasive cancers (0.96 S/m) showed higher mean conductivity compared to in situ cancers (0.57 S/m) (P {\textless} 0.0005). Conclusion This study shows that conductivity mapping of breast cancers is feasible using a noninvasive in vivo MREPT technique combined with a coil combination process. The method may provide a tool in the MR diagnosis of breast cancer. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2015;42:371–378.},

	abstract = {Introduction: 
Early detection of breast cancer saves lives. Existing detecting techniques are invasive. Electrical bioimpedance is a noninvasive technique and has a high diagnostic potential.

Methods:
An impedance value different from the normal can predict a physiological abnormality. The idea is to use a designed bioimpedance device to early detect breast cancer. A low-frequency current (1 kHz, 0.9 mA) is injected to each breast to measure the extracellular resistances. The resistances of the two breasts are then measured, and if there is a significant difference, warning is displayed. The performance was tested on a set of reference resistors, and the validation was done in vitro on (Na+Cl-) solutions and in vivo on a group of forty volunteer women.

Results:
The results confirm that the electrical conductivity of an ionic solution is proportional to its concentration. The concentration and the resistance are strongly correlated (correlation coefficient of 0.97). The accuracy and the repeatability of the measures were satisfactory. Early detection means that we can detect small extracellular concentration variations into the breast (from 0.6 g/l). In vivo measurements made it possible to set the threshold at 50 ohm. If the difference between the two measured breast resistances is greater than this threshold, we advise the patient to consult a doctor promptly.

Conclusion:
The difference between measured resistances of the right and left breast is a pertinent parameter to early detect the presence of a cancer. The lowest resistance value (RR or RL) can provide information on the breast affected by the cancer (right or left). Various improvements in the system are possible but already the results are encouraging. In the future, this system could be integrated into a bra.},

This is particularly relevant for image-guided thermal treatments (e.g. hyperthermia and thermal ablation) delivering heat via focused ultrasound (FUS), radiofrequency (RF), microwave (MW), or laser energy; temperature induced changes in tissue properties are of relevance in relation to predicting tissue temperature profile, monitoring during treatment, and evaluation of treatment results., This paper presents a literature survey of temperature dependence of electrical (electrical conductivity, resistivity, permittivity) and thermal tissue properties (thermal conductivity, specific heat, diffusivity). Data of soft tissues (liver, prostate, muscle, kidney, uterus, collagen, myocardium and spleen) for temperatures between 5 to 90°C, and dielectric properties in the frequency range between 460 kHz and 3 GHz are reported. Furthermore, perfusion changes in tumors including carcinomas, sarcomas, rhabdomyosarcoma, adenocarcinoma and ependymoblastoma in response to hyperthmic temperatures up to 46°C are presented. Where appropriate, mathematical models to describe temperature dependence of properties are presented., The presented data is valuable for mathematical models that predict tissue temperature during thermal therapies (e.g. hyperthermia or thermal ablation), as well as for applications related to prediction and monitoring of temperature induced tissue changes.},

The results of these study cases show that the fractional order model is a suitable candidate for this particular application. The hypothesis tested in this paper provides new tools for glucose concentration monitoring and measurement. © 2017, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this work is to describe a first approach to a smart bioimpedance spectroscopy device for its application to the estimation of body composition. The proposed device is capable of carrying out bioimpedance measurements in multiple configurable frequencies, processing the data to obtain the modulus and the bioimpedance phase in each of the frequencies, and transmitting the processed information wirelessly. Another novelty of this work is a new algorithm for the identification of Cole model parameters, which is the basis of body composition estimation through bioimpedance spectroscopy analysis. Against other proposals, the main advantages of the proposed method are its robustness against parasitic effects by employing an extended version of Cole model with phase delay and three dispersions, its simplicity and low computational load. The results obtained in a validation study with respiratory patients show the accuracy and feasibility of the proposed technology for bioimpedance measurements. The precision and validity of the algorithm was also proven in a validation study with peritoneal dialysis patients. The proposed method was the most accurate compared with other existing algorithms. Moreover, in those cases affected by parasitic effects the proposed algorithm provided better approximations to the bioimpedance values than a reference device.},

	abstract = {Objective: Bioimpedance measurements are mostly performed utilizing gel electrodes to decrease the occurring electrode-skin impedance. Since in many measurement environments this kind of electrode is not appropriate, the usability of dry electrodes is analysed. Approach: The development of five different kinds of dry electrodes, including gold, stainless steel, carbon rubber and metallized textile as contact materials are proposed. All test electrodes are based on a circular printed circuit board as carrier and have the same contact surface dimensions. To compare the electrodes’ characteristics, the occurring electrode-skin impedances are measured under variation of signal frequency, contact duration, contact pressure, placement position and subjects. Additionally, all measurements are performed with silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) dry gel electrodes for comparison purposes. Main results: The analysed parameters play a significant role regarding the electrode-skin impedance. Choosing a wise setup of these parameters can decrease the electrode-skin impedance of dry electrodes down to ranges of dry gel electrodes and even below. Significance: The usage of dry electrodes is one of the most difficult challenges when transferring scientific measurement techniques to clinical environments or commercial products but it is indispensable for many applications like body composition measurements or prosthesis control.},

	abstract = {Accurate and reliable measurement of the electrical impedance spectrum is an essential requirement in order to draw relevant conclusions in many fields and a variety of applications; in particular, for biological processes. Even in the state-of-the-art methods developed for this purpose, the accuracy and efficacy of impedance measurements are reduced in biological systems, due to the regular occurrence of parameters causing measurement errors such as residual impedance, parasitic capacitance, generator anomalies, and so on. Recent observations have reported the necessity of decreasing such inaccuracies whenever measurements are performed in the ultra-low frequency range, as the above-mentioned errors are almost entirely absent in such cases. The current research work proposes a method which can reject the anomalies listed above when measuring in the ultra-low frequency range, facilitating data collection at the same time. To demonstrate our hypothesis, originating from the consideration of the determinant role of the measuring frequency, a physical model is proposed to examine the effectiveness of our method by measuring across the commonly used vs. ultra-low frequency ranges. Validation measurements reflect that the range of frequencies and the accuracy is much greater than in state-of-the-art methods. Using the proposed new impedance examination technique, biological system characterization can be carried out more accurately.},

Usually however, the time constant of tissue or cell suspensions is conductance dependent, and so the Cole model is incompatible with general relaxation theory and not a model of first choice. An alternative model with conductance as a free parameter influencing the characteristic time constant of the biomaterial has been analyzed. With this free-conductance model it is possible to separately follow CPE and conductive processes, and the nominal time constant no longer corresponds to the apex of the circular arc in the complex plane.},

	abstract = {Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) has been recently proposed as a simple non-invasive technique to monitor the amount of fat and liquids contained inside the human body. While the technique capabilities are still questioned, a simple and low cost device capable of performing this kind of measurements would help testing it on many patients with minimal effort. This paper describes an extremely low cost implementation of an EIS system suitable for medical applications that is based on a simple commercial Arduino Board whose cost is below 50\$. The circuit takes advantage of the ADC and DAC made available by the microcontroller of the Arduino boards and employs a logarithmic amplifier to extend the impedance measuring range to 6 decades without using complex programmable gain amplifiers. This way the device can use electrodes with sizes in the range of 1 cm2 to 40 cm2. The EIS can be measured in the frequency range of 1 Hz to 100 kHz and in the impedance range of 1 kΩ to 1 GΩ. The instrument automatically compensates the DC voltage due to the skin/electrode contact and runs on batteries. The EIS traces can be stored inside the device and transferred to the PC with a wireless link avoiding safety issues.},

Usually however, the time constant of tissue or cell suspensions is conductance dependent, and so the Cole model is incompatible with general relaxation theory and not a model of first choice. An alternative model with conductance as a free parameter influencing the characteristic time constant of the biomaterial has been analyzed. With this free-conductance model it is possible to separately follow CPE and conductive processes, and the nominal time constant no longer corresponds to the apex of the circular arc in the complex plane.},

	abstract = {The Cole model is a widely used fractional circuit model in electrical bioimpedance applications for evaluating the content and status of biological tissues and fluids. Existing methods for estimating the Cole impedance parameters are often based on multi-frequency data obtained from stepped-sine measurements fitted using a complex nonlinear least square (CNLS) algorithm. Newly emerged numerical methods from the magnitude of electrical bioimpedance data-only do not need CNLS fitting, but they still require multi-frequency stepped-sine data. This study proposes a novel approach to estimating the Cole impedance parameters that combines a numerical and time-domain fitting method based on a single-frequency DC-biased sinusoidal current excitation. First, the transient and steady-state voltage responses along with the current excitation are acquired in electrical bioimpedance measurement. From the sampled data, a numerical method is applied to provide the initial estimation of the Cole impedance parameters, which are then used in a time-domain iterative fitting algorithm. The accuracy of the algorithm proposed is tested with noisy electrical bioimpedance simulations. The maximum relative error of the estimated Cole impedance parameters is 1\% considering 2\% (34 dB) additive Gaussian noise. Experimental measurements performed on a 2R-1C circuit and some fruit samples show a mean difference less than 1\% and 5\%, respectively, compared to the Cole impedance parameters estimated from a commercial electrical bioimpedance analyzer performing stepped-sine measurements and CNLS fitting. This is the first method that allows estimating the Cole impedance parameters from single-frequency electrical bioimpedance data. The approach presented could find broad use in many applications, including single-frequency body impedance analysis.},

Fractional calculus can provide a concise model for the description of the dynamic events that occur in biological tissues. The concepts of fractional calculus has been successfully applied in physics, chemistry and material science, electrodes and viscolelastic materials over extended ranges of time and frequency. In this paper, the fractional order impedance model is presented and compared with the measured impedance. The model parameters are related to various physical conditions of the test-cells and a baseline measurements along with blind evaluation are presented. The results indicate that the proposed model is valid in a limited range of frequencies and generalization for higher order models is possible.},

	doi = {10.1007/978-1-60327-101-1_3},
	abstract = {Bayesian regularized artificial neural networks (BRANNs) are more robust than standard back-propagation nets and can reduce or eliminate the need for lengthy cross-validation. Bayesian regularization is a mathematical process that converts a nonlinear regression into a "well-posed" statistical problem in the manner of a ridge regression. The advantage of BRANNs is that the models are robust and the validation process, which scales as O(N2) in normal regression methods, such as back propagation, is unnecessary. These networks provide solutions to a number of problems that arise in QSAR modeling, such as choice of model, robustness of model, choice of validation set, size of validation effort, and optimization of network architecture. They are difficult to overtrain, since evidence procedures provide an objective Bayesian criterion for stopping training. They are also difficult to overfit, because the BRANN calculates and trains on a number of effective network parameters or weights, effectively turning off those that are not relevant. This effective number is usually considerably smaller than the number of weights in a standard fully connected back-propagation neural net. Automatic relevance determination (ARD) of the input variables can be used with BRANNs, and this allows the network to "estimate" the importance of each input. The ARD method ensures that irrelevant or highly correlated indices used in the modeling are neglected as well as showing which are the most important variables for modeling the activity data. This chapter outlines the equations that define the BRANN method plus a flowchart for producing a BRANN-QSAR model. Some results of the use of BRANNs on a number of data sets are illustrated and compared with other linear and nonlinear models.},

The contribution of this paper is a description of our dataset, our coding process to indiciate tweets with health related advice, and our analysis and comparisons of the characteristics of the tweets with and without health-related advice. These contributions provide the basis for future research on semi-automated classifiers for health-related advice and efforts to reduce the spread of harmful health advice.},

	abstract = {The semantic segmentation of robotic surgery video and the delineation of robotic instruments are important for enabling automation. Despite major recent progresses, the majority of the latest deep learning models for instrument detection and segmentation rely on large datasets with ground truth labels. While demonstrating the capability, reliance on large labelled data is a problem for practical applications because systems would need to be re-trained on domain variations such as procedure type or instrument sets. In this paper, we propose to alleviate this problem by training deep learning models on datasets that are synthesised using image-to-image translation techniques and we investigate different methods to perform this process optimally. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the same deep network architecture for robotic instrument segmentation can be trained on both real data and on our proposed synthetic data without affecting the quality of the output models’ performance. We show this for several recent approaches and provide experimental support on publicly available datasets, which highlight the potential value of this approach.},

Unlike Newton's method, the Gauss–Newton algorithm can only be used to minimize a sum of squared function values, but it has the advantage that second derivatives, which can be challenging to compute, are not required.Non-linear least squares problems arise, for instance, in non-linear regression, where parameters in a model are sought such that the model is in good agreement with available observations.
The method is named after the mathematicians Carl Friedrich Gauss and Isaac Newton, and first appeared in Gauss' 1809 work Theoria motus corporum coelestium in sectionibus conicis solem ambientum.},

	abstract = {In mathematics and computing, the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm (LMA or just LM), also known as the  damped least-squares (DLS) method, is used to solve non-linear least squares problems.  These minimization problems arise especially in least squares curve fitting.
The LMA is used in many software applications for solving generic curve-fitting problems. However, as with many fitting algorithms, the LMA finds only a local minimum, which is not necessarily the global minimum.  The LMA interpolates between the Gauss–Newton algorithm (GNA) and the method of gradient descent. The LMA is more robust than the GNA, which means that in many cases it finds a solution even if it starts very far off the final minimum. For well-behaved functions and reasonable starting parameters, the LMA tends to be slower than the GNA. LMA can also be viewed as Gauss–Newton using a trust region approach.
The algorithm was first published in 1944 by Kenneth Levenberg, while working at the Frankford Army Arsenal. It was rediscovered in 1963 by Donald Marquardt, who worked as a statistician at DuPont, and independently by Girard, Wynne and Morrison.},

	abstract = {The semantic segmentation of robotic surgery video and the delineation of robotic instruments are important for enabling automation. Despite major recent progresses, the majority of the latest deep learning models for instrument detection and segmentation rely on large datasets with ground truth labels. While demonstrating the capability, reliance on large labelled data is a problem for practical applications because systems would need to be re-trained on domain variations such as procedure type or instrument sets. In this paper, we propose to alleviate this problem by training deep learning models on datasets that are synthesised using image-to-image translation techniques and we investigate different methods to perform this process optimally. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the same deep network architecture for robotic instrument segmentation can be trained on both real data and on our proposed synthetic data without affecting the quality of the output models’ performance. We show this for several recent approaches and provide experimental support on publicly available datasets, which highlight the potential value of this approach.},

	abstract = {In modern racing games programming non-player characters with believable and sophisticated behaviors is getting increasingly challenging. Recently, several works in the literature suggested that computational intelligence can provide effective solutions to support the development process of NPCs. In this paper, we applied the Behavior Analysis and Training (BAT) methodology to define a behavior-based architecture for the NPCs in The Open Racing Car Simulator (TORCS), a well-known open source racing game. Then, we focused on two major overtaking behaviors: (i) the overtaking of a fast opponent either on a straight stretch or on a large bend; (ii) the overtaking on a tight bend, which typically requires a rather advanced braking policy. We applied simple reinforcement learning, namely Q-learning, to learn both these overtaking behaviors. We tested our approach in several overtaking situations and compared the learned behaviors against one of the best NPC provided with TORCS. Our results suggest that, exploiting the proposed behavior-based architecture, Q-learning can effectively learn sophisticated behaviors and outperform programmed NPCs. In addition, we also show that the same approach can be successfully applied to adapt a previously learned behavior to a dynamically changing game situation.},

@book{butz_optimized_2009,
	title = {Optimized sensory-motor couplings plus strategy extensions for the {TORCS} car racing challenge},
	abstract = {The TORCS simulated car racing competition was introduced over a year ago. It asks for the design of racing car control strategies that have to rely on local track and driving information only, such as distance sensors, angle-to-track axis, or velocity vectors. Thus, the competition asks for strategies that are sensory-motorically grounded rather than strategies that can be designed (online or even offline) by an external observer that has full track knowledge. Moreover, the competition enforces the development of rather general driving strategies since optimization is on driving success in general rather than driving success on one particular track. This paper describes the steps taken to develop COBOSTAR, an autonomous racing car strategy with several general, context-dependent behavioral modules and strategic advancements. Most of the behavioral parameters were optimized with covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy techniques. COBOSTAR won the simulated car racing competition at the IEEE Congress of Evolutionary Computation (CEC 2009) and there is still lots of room for further optimizations and strategy additions. Apart from describing the COBOSTAR racer in detail, we also outline possible next steps and future challenges.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this document is to introduce the structure of TORCS to the general artificial intelligence and machine learning community and explain how it is possible to tests agents on the platform. The open racing car simulator (TORCS [14]), is a modern, modular, highlyportable multi-player, multi-agent car simulator. Its high degree of modularity and portability render it ideal for artificial intelligence research. Indeed, a number of research-oriented competitions and papers have already appeared that make use of the TORCS engine. The purpose of this document is to introduce the structure of TORCS to the general artificial intelligence and machine learning community and explain how it is possible to tests agents on the platform. TORCS can be used to develop artificially intelligent (AI) agents for a variety of problems. At the car level, new simulation modules can be developed, which include intelligent control systems for various car components. At the driver level, a low-level API gives detailed (but only partial) access to the simulation state. This could be used to develop anything from mid-level control systems to complex driving agents that find optimal racing lines, react successfully in unexpected situations and make good tactical race decisions. Finally, for researchers that like a challenge and are also interested in visual processing, a 3d projection interface is available.},

	abstract = {Autonomous cars control the steering wheel, acceleration and the brake pedal, the gears and the clutch using sensory information from multiple sources. Like a human driver, it understands the current situation on the roads from the live streaming of sensory values. The decision-making module often suffers from the limited range of sensors and complexity due to the large number of sensors and actuators. Because it is tedious and difficult to design the controller manually from trial-and-error, it is desirable to use intelligent optimization algorithms. In this work, we propose optimizing the parameters of an autonomous car controller using self-adaptive evolutionary strategies (SAESs) which co-evolve solutions and mutation steps for each parameter. We also describe how the most generalized parameter set can be retrieved from the process of optimization. Open-source car racing simulation software (TORCS) is used to test the goodness of the proposed methods on 6 different tracks. Experimental results show that the SAES is competitive with the manual design of authors and a simple ES.},

	abstract = {In mathematics and computing, the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm (LMA or just LM), also known as the  damped least-squares (DLS) method, is used to solve non-linear least squares problems.  These minimization problems arise especially in least squares curve fitting.
The LMA is used in many software applications for solving generic curve-fitting problems. However, as with many fitting algorithms, the LMA finds only a local minimum, which is not necessarily the global minimum.  The LMA interpolates between the Gauss–Newton algorithm (GNA) and the method of gradient descent. The LMA is more robust than the GNA, which means that in many cases it finds a solution even if it starts very far off the final minimum. For well-behaved functions and reasonable starting parameters, the LMA tends to be slower than the GNA. LMA can also be viewed as Gauss–Newton using a trust region approach.
The algorithm was first published in 1944 by Kenneth Levenberg, while working at the Frankford Army Arsenal. It was rediscovered in 1963 by Donald Marquardt, who worked as a statistician at DuPont, and independently by Girard, Wynne and Morrison.},

Unlike Newton's method, the Gauss–Newton algorithm can only be used to minimize a sum of squared function values, but it has the advantage that second derivatives, which can be challenging to compute, are not required.Non-linear least squares problems arise, for instance, in non-linear regression, where parameters in a model are sought such that the model is in good agreement with available observations.
The method is named after the mathematicians Carl Friedrich Gauss and Isaac Newton, and first appeared in Gauss' 1809 work Theoria motus corporum coelestium in sectionibus conicis solem ambientum.},

	abstract = {Stock price prediction has been an important research theme both academically and practically. Various methods to predict stock prices have been studied until now. The feature that explains the stock price by a cross-section analysis is called a "factor" in the field of finance. Many empirical studies in finance have identified which stocks having features in the cross-section relatively increase and which decrease in terms of price. Recently, stock price prediction methods using machine learning, especially deep learning, have been proposed since the relationship between these factors and stock prices is complex and non-linear. However, there are no practical examples for actual investment management. In this paper, therefore, we present a cross-sectional daily stock price prediction framework using deep learning for actual investment management. For example, we build a portfolio with information available at the time of market closing and invest at the time of market opening the next day. We perform empirical analysis in the Japanese stock market and confirm the profitability of our framework.},

We found that a slightly unconventional "stacked 2D" approach provides much better classification performance than simple 2D patches without requiring significantly more computational power. We also examined the popular "tri-planar" approach used in some recently published studies, and found that it provides much better results than the 2D approaches, but also with a moderate increase in computational power requirement. Finally, we evaluated a full 3D convolutional architecture, and found that it provides marginally better results than the tri-planar approach, but at the cost of a very significant increase in computational power requirement.},

	abstract = {Surgical tool segmentation is used for detection, tracking and pose estimation of the tools in the vicinity of surgical scenes. It is considered as an essential task in surgical phase recognition and flow identification. Surgical flow identification is an unresolved task in the domain of context-aware surgical systems, which is used extensively on computer assisted intervention (CAI). CAI is used for staff assignment, automated guidance during intervention, surgical alert systems, automatic indexing of surgical video databases and optimisation of the real-time scheduling of operating room. Semantic segmentation is used for accurate delineation of surgical tools from the background. In semantic segmentation, each label is assigned to a class as a tool or a background. In this presented work, we applied a hybrid method utilising both recurrent and convolutional networks to achieve higher accuracy of surgical tools segmentation. The proposed method is trained and tested using a public dataset MICCAI 2016 Endoscopic Vision Challenge Robotic Instruments dataset "EndoVis". We achieved better performance using the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods on the same dataset for benchmarking. We achieved a balanced accuracy of 93.3\% and Jaccard index of 82.7\%.},

The straightforward accessibility to images in surgical interventions makes deep neural networks enormously powerful for solving classification problems in complex surgical scenarios. The objective of this work is to provide readers a survey on deep learning models applied to minimally invasive surgery, identifying the different architectures used depending on the application, the results achieved until now, and the publicly available surgical datasets that can be used for validating new studies. A total of 85 publications have been extracted from manual research from four databases (IEEE Xplorer, Springer Link, Science Direct, and ACM Digital Library). After analyzing all these studies, they have been classified into four applications: surgical image analysis, surgical task analysis, surgical skill assessment, and automation of surgical tasks. This work provides a technical description of these works and a comparison among them. Finally, promising research directions to advance in this field are identified.},

The problem is challenging because different illumination conditions, bleeding, smoke and occlusions can reduce algorithm robustness. At present labelled data for training deep learning models is still lacking for semantic surgical instrument segmentation and in this paper we show that it may be possible to use robot kinematic data coupled with laparoscopic images to alleviate the labelling problem. We propose a new deep learning based model for parallel processing of both laparoscopic and simulation images for robust segmentation of surgical tools. Due to the lack of laparoscopic frames annotated with both segmentation ground truth and kinematic information a new custom dataset was generated using the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) and is made available.},

We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

	abstract = {In recent years, an increasing number of people have myopia in China, especially the younger generation. Common myopia may develop into high myopia. High myopia causes visual impairment and blindness. Parapapillary atrophy (PPA) is a typical retinal pathology related to high myopia, which is also a basic clue for diagnosing high myopia. Therefore, accurate segmentation of the PPA is essential for high myopia diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we propose an optimized Unet (OT-Unet) to solve this important task. OT-Unet uses one of the pre-trained models: Visual Geometry Group (VGG), ResNet, and Res2Net, as a backbone and is combined with edge attention, parallel partial decoder, and reverse attention modules to improve the segmentation accuracy. In general, using the pre-trained models can improve the accuracy with fewer samples. The edge attention module extracts contour information, the parallel partial decoder module combines the multi-scale features, and the reverse attention module integrates high- and low-level features. We also propose an augmented loss function to increase the weight of complex pixels to enable the network to segment more complex lesion areas. Based on a dataset containing 360 images (Including 26 pictures provided by PALM), the proposed OT-Unet achieves a high AUC (Area Under Curve) of 0.9235, indicating a significant improvement over the original Unet (0.7917).},

	abstract = {Tet Repressor proteins (otherwise known as TetR) are proteins playing an important role in conferring antibiotic resistance to large categories of bacterial species. 
Tetracycline (Tc) is a broad family of antibiotics to which bacteria have evolved resistance. Tc normally kills bacteria by binding to the bacterial ribosome and halting protein synthesis. The expression of Tc resistance genes is regulated by the repressor TetR. TetR represses the expression of TetA, a membrane protein that pumps out substances toxic to the bacteria like Tc, by binding the tetA operator. In Tc-resistant bacteria, TetA will pump out Tc before it can bind to the ribosome because the repressive action of TetR on TetA is halted by binding of Tc to TetR. Therefore, TetR may have an important role  in helping scientists to better understand mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and how to treat antibiotic resistant bacteria. TetR is one of many proteins in the TetR protein family, which is so named because TetR is the most well characterized member.TetR is used in artificially engineered gene regulatory networks because of its capacity for fine regulation of promoters. In the absence of Tc or analogs like ATc, basal expression of TetR-regulated promoters is low, but expression rises sharply in the presence of even a minute quantity of Tc. The tetA gene is also present in the widely used E. coli cloning vector pBR322, where it is often referred to by the name of its tetracycline-resistance phenotype, TetR, not to be confused with TetR.},

	doi = {10.1080/08998280.2011.11928688},
	abstract = {Results from a large retrospective study of patients with IBC performed over a 20-year period demonstrated that initial treatment with an anthracycline-based regimen followed by local therapy resulted in 5 - and 10-year survival rates of 40\% and 33\%, respectively. It is estimated that 207,090 women will be diagnosed with and 39,840 women will die of breast cancer in 2010 in the United States. Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) accounts for approximately 1\% to 6\% of all breast cancer cases in the US (1, 2). This rare and aggressive form of breast cancer is diagnosed clinically by the rapid onset of diffuse erythema and edema (peau d'orange) of at least a third of the skin overlying the breast (3) (Figure ​(Figure11). Tumor emboli blocking dermal lymphatic channels lead to the characteristic “inflammatory” skin changes; however, this is not necessary to make the diagnosis (4). The primary tumor of IBC is classified as T4d by definition, even if no underlying palpable mass is present in the breast.

Women diagnosed with IBC have inferior survival outcomes compared with women with other forms of breast cancer. IBC patients tend to be younger, and IBC tumors are more likely to overexpress HER2 than non-IBC tumors (5). Hormone receptor negativity also occurs at a higher frequency in IBC tumors (6). At presentation, most women with IBC have lymph node involvement, and approximately one third have distant sites of disease (7, 8). Historically, attempts to treat IBC with surgery alone or surgery combined with radiation therapy resulted in median overall survival times of less than 15 months and local recurrence rates as high as 50\% (9). 
 
The treatment of IBC has dramatically improved with the advent of multimodality therapy. Results from a large retrospective study of patients with IBC performed over a 20-year period demonstrated that initial treatment with an anthracycline-based regimen followed by local therapy resulted in 5 - and 10-year survival rates of 40\% and 33\%, respectively (10). The incorporation of taxanes has also been associated with higher pathologic complete response rates and better survival outcomes. According to data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, for women who were diagnosed with IBC between 1988 and 2001, the 5-year survival rate was approximately 40\%. This compares with about 87\% for all breast cancers combined. 
 
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) panel recommends preoperative chemotherapy with an anthracycline-based regimen with or without taxanes for the initial treatment of patients with IBC. Inclusion of trastuzumab in the chemotherapy regimen is recommended for patients with HER2-positive disease. Patients responding to preoperative treatment should then undergo mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection. Any remaining planned chemotherapy should be completed after the mastectomy, followed sequentially by endocrine therapy in patients with hormone receptor–positive disease. Finally, postmastectomy chest wall and regional node irradiation is recommended after the completion of any planned chemotherapy. As a historical reference, the Baylor Sammons Cancer Center medical committee and breast site committee constructed IBC treatment guidelines in 1989 that are in all practical purposes identical to the current NCCN guidelines. 
 
In 2010, the joint medical committee at Baylor Sammons Cancer Center requested a review of the IBC cases seen at our institution from 2003 to 2009 to evaluate compliance with the aforementioned guidelines as well as measure Baylor Dallas' outcomes data in accordance with the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB). This report presents those findings.},

	abstract = {To determine the impact of tumor progression on the reversibility of Neu-induced tumorigenesis, we have used the tetracycline regulatory system to conditionally express activated Neu in the mammary epithelium of transgenic mice. When induced with doxycycline, bitransgenic MMTV-rtTA/TetO-NeuNT mice develop multiple invasive mammary carcinomas, essentially all of which regress to a clinically undetectable state following transgene deinduction. This demonstrates that Neu-initiated tumorigenesis is reversible. Strikingly, extensive lung metastases arising from Neu-induced mammary tumors also rapidly and fully regress following the abrogation of Neu expression. However, despite the near universal dependence of both primary tumors and metastases on Neu transgene expression, most animals bearing fully regressed Neu-induced tumors ultimately develop recurrent tumors that have progressed to a Neu-independent state.},
